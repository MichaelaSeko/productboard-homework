The goal of this exercise is to write automated tests for the TO-DO application using [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io).

When you will visit us in our office, we will go through the code together and look at how the code is organized; what's the structure of the tests and how they're organized inside test suites; how you use selectors; and which Cypress APIs you chose and why. If we have enough time, we will also pair program some test cases together so it will be the best if bring your own computer with your working development environment already setup to speed things up.

Feel free to get creative and come up with something cool beyond what's defined by the assignment if you want to impress us (we're sure you will! ðŸš€)
